This tutorial is part of a series created by the University of Toronto Data Science Group lead by Christopher Alemao.
The tutorial focuses on using a library in python known as pandas to clean data. Learning how to use pandas to manipulate data is more efficient than using excel. 
We can automate a lot of the process including repairing data holes and eliminating duplicates. When dealing with millions of data points, it would be extremely difficult to comb through data looking for missing information. 
Since pandas is so versatile — even if you start your analysis in Excel — you can easily import it over to Python and continue. You can also always start in pandas and use the software to clean up and organize your data, and then move over to Excel to visualize it easier. Pandas’ adaptability makes a switch between the two a breeze. You can perform the easy calculations in Excel, then use pandas’ more complex programs to dive in deep.
